# Welcome to Latin Vocab!

This is an app I created to help with my Latin class. The vocab is specifically from the _Latin for the New Millennium_ textbook, with only a few chapters from Volume 1 right now, though I plan on adding more very soon. User settings are saved through accounts, though practice progress or statistics are not saved (feature coming soon).

The app is built using React Router and is hosted on Cloudflare infra.
